# stack:data-structures

                A stack is a data structure that holds a list of elements.
                A stack works based on the LIFO principle i.e., Last In, First out, meaning that the most recently added element is the first one to remove.
                A stack has two main operations that occur only at the top of the stack: push and pop
# Operations

Push operation

      The push operation places an element at the top of stack.
      
Pop operation

       Pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack.
